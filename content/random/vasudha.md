Since August 2023, we‚Äôve been building a small but meaningful community focused on spiritual and cultural connection.

### Bhajan Jam üé∂

**Every 3rd Saturday**, we gather at the [Sri Kodandarama Temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MnUrSnLQHdAMJf1VA) in Koramangala for a bhajan jam session. Whether you‚Äôre an experienced singer or just someone who loves spiritual music, we welcome you to join our sessions. No prior musical experience required - just bring your enthusiasm and devotion!

The community has grown to over **140 members organically** - just word of mouth.

### Swadesh Yatra üèïÔ∏è

We also organize **offbeat cultural trips** to lesser-known but deeply rooted places across India.
Some of our past trips include:

* **[Swaesh Sringeri](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tLgcDRyGbiXrzLkG2uwDkhUwhXCsgV3/view?usp=sharing)**
