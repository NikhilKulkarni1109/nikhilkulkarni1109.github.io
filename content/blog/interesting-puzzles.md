Back in the day, my mom ran a small *Palnaghar ([Crèche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8che#:~:text=Child%20care%20center%2C%20an%20organization%20of%20adults%20who%20take%20care%20of%20children%20in%20place%20of%20their%20parents))* at home. It was a warm, homely place where kids would come, sit, and play while their parents were at work.
I first started creating & finding puzzles for the kids, but now I mostly have a collection of puzzles for adults.

Here’s a small selection of puzzles I enjoy:

## For Adults
 
1. [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)
