Think of it as our DIY version of <a href="https://www.glean.com/" target="_blank">Glean</a>


We indexed all internal docs (Google Docs, Sites, Confluence) into a vector DB.
Added a few common user profiles like Support, Tech, PMs, and Founders, and used system prompts + RAG to give useful answers with links to the right docs.

Founders and customer support teams used it to pull insights from sales calls and customer chats.
