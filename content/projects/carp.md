I did my research internship at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the guidance of [Prof. Andrew Lim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iDEgcFQAAAAJ&hl=en).

I worked on modeling road-sweeping vehicle routes as a [Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP)](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?q=capacitated+arc+routing+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart), considering things like turn penalties, multi-curb edges, and vehicle capacity limits. I implemented a few research papers and tried tweaking the algorithms to beat the existing SOTA and aim for a publication.

It didn’t reach the publication stage, but I learned a lot about academic rigor, the level of detail and effort it needs, and picked up some interesting math.
