I'm Nikhil Kulkarni, a software engineer from India 🇮🇳, currently working at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce</a>, where I build and manage large-scale data pipelines with Airflow to support Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work across a wide range of environments - from building large-scale systems at Microsoft to being a founding engineer in a four-person startup team at <a href="https://www.itilite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITILITE</a>.

Outside of work, I enjoy solving math problems and going on backpacking trips with my childhood friend Rohit.

Here’s my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RuLDdxqHjlWKk2tyXedmwkrPF6t96oi/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CV</a> 📝
